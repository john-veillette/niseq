    '''Predictive power analysis via Bayesian bootstrap

    Computes the predictive power non-parametrically using the Bayesian
    bootstrap. Optionally, you can condition on the current data to get
    conditional power, which is useful for adaptive designs. Only valid for
    one-sample (or paired-sample) tests.

    Statistics computed from resamples using the Bayesian bootstrap, as opposed
    to the frequentist boostrap, can be interpreted as draws from the posterior
    distribution with an uninformative prior [1]. Thus, results here can be
    conveniently interpreted as the Bayesian predictive power. As recommended by
    [2] (not in English) and helpfully restated by [3] (in English), resampling
    weights are drawn from Dirichlet(alpha = 4) for a better approximation.

    This functionality is experimental. It is the best catch-all way to do a
    power analysis for permutation tests I can think of, and similar resampling
    approaches to estimating power have been used in the literature (e.g. by
    [4]); however, it should be noted that the neuroimaging literature has not
    converged upon a standardized approach to performing power analyses.
    The Bayesian bootstrap approach used here incorporates uncertainty about
    the effect size into the power estimate, which is handy since uncertainty
    about the true effect size is considerable following a small pilot study, or
    even a typical psychology/neuroimaging sample size, as pointed out by [5].

    Parameters
    -----------
    X : array, shape (n_observations, p[, q][, r])
        The data from which to resample. ``X`` should contain the observations
        for one group or paired differences. The first dimension of the array
        is the number of observations; remaining dimensions comprise the size of
        a single observation. See documentation for user-input ``test_func`` for
        more details.
    test_func : function
        The one-sample sequential test you want to run a power analysis for.
        Must accept ``look_times``, ``n_max``, and ``alpha`` arguments and
        return results, the middle two of which are the p-values for each look
        and the adjusted alphas, respectively. This could be any user-facing
        function from ``niseq`` that ends in ``_1samp``.
    %(look_times)s
    %(n_max)s
    %(alpha)s
    conditional : bool, default: ``False``
        If ``True``, performs a conditional power analysis; that is, computes
        the probability of a design rejecting the null hypothesis given that the
        data in ``X`` has already been collected and is included in the
        analysis, as in an adaptive design. If ``False`` (default), performs a
        prospective power analysis (e.g. if you're using pilot data or data from
        another study to inform sample size planning for a study that hasn't
        begun data collection).
    n_simulations: int, default: ``1024``
        Number of bootstrap resamples/simulations to perform.
    %(seed)s
    %(n_jobs)s
    **test_func_kwargs:
        You may input any arguments you'd like passed to ``test_func``.


    Returns
    --------
    res : dict
        A results dictionary with keys:

        ``'uncorr_instantaneous_power'`` : list of float
            The power of a fixed-sample statistical test performed at each look.
        ``'rejection_probability'`` : list of float
            The probability that a sequential test rejects the null hypothesis
            (for the first time) at each look time.
        ``'cumulative_power'`` : list of float
            The power of a sequential test to reject the null hypothesis by each
            look time. ``res['cumulative_power'][-1]`` is the power of the full
            sequential procedure.
        ``'uncorr_cumulative_power'`` : list of float
            Cumulative power if the rejection threshold at each look was not
            corrected using alpha-spending (as it should be).
        ``'n_expected'`` : float
            The expected sample size for the sequential procedure.
        ``'n_simulations'`` : int
            The number of bootstrap resamples used.
        ``'n_orig_data'`` : int
            The sample size of the original data ``X``, i.e. ``X.shape[0]``.
        ``'conditional'`` : bool
            Whether the power analysis that was run was conditional (``True``)
            or prospective (``False``).
        ``'test_func'`` : str
            Name of the sequential test function used.
        ``'test_func_kwargs'`` : dict
            A record of the arguments passed to the test function, including
            ``look_times`` and ``n_max``.

    Notes
    --------
    The significance level of the test used is specified in ``test_func``, and
    thus can be modified by passing an argument to ``test_func`` using
    ``**test_func_kwargs``.
